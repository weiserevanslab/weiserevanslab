Austin Jolly is from Lakewood, Colorado and is a current MD/PhD student completing his thesis project in the Weiser-Evans Laboratory. Austin attended the University of Colorado at Boulder for his undergraduate studies, where he majored in Integrative Physiology and graduated with Honors distinction. During his time in Boulder, Austin was an undergraduate researcher in the laboratory of Dr. Xiang Wang where he studied applied organic chemistry to synthesize compounds that showed efficacy in potentiating antibiotics to combat multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria. Austin also served as a teaching assistant in the human anatomy labs where he facilitated dissection learning and helped students master the organization of the human body. Austin has a strong interest in cardiovascular medicine and is very excited to be completing his PhD in the Weiser-Evans lab to further his training in basic science and vascular biology.

Outside of the lab, Austin enjoys snowboarding in the winter time and catching trout during the summer. Austin plays Ultimate Frisbee, and his team recently won the League Championship for Mile High Ultimate!
