# Role of PTEN in pathological vascular remodeling:
Using an unbiased screen to identify novel genes regulating a unique smooth muscle phenotype expressed in early vascular development and during vascular disease progression, we uncovered a role for the tumor suppressor, PTEN, as an essential regulator of smooth muscle phenotype. A parallel, but separate research direction identified the extracellular heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan, as an essential component driving smooth muscle differentiation and vessel maturation; subsequent studies linked perlecan regulation of PTEN to vessel maturation. Therefore, through two parallel, but independent research paths, we were the first to identify PTEN as an indispensable regulator of smooth muscle differentiation and vessel development.  At this time, while PTEN was actively being studied as a tumor suppressor commonly mutated in a wide variety of human cancers, very little was known of its physiological activity in other systems and there was no information of PTEN regulating SMC function. Our most recent original findings revealed a novel role for PTEN as a transcriptional co-factor for the transcription factor, SRF, a master smooth muscle differentiation regulator, never before been demonstrated in any cell system.  Translationally, using coronary arteries micro-dissected from explanted human hearts at the time of transplant, we found that loss of PTEN is associated with atherosclerosis progression, and the extent of SMC PTEN loss correlates with lesion severity.  Most recently, our findings show that systemic PTEN upregulation protects against pathological vascular remodeling making PTEN a highly significant therapeutic target.  Collectively, we demonstrated that PTEN regulates cell autonomous events, including differentiation, proliferation, and pro-fibrotic vascular remodeling, as well as non-autonomous events, including inflammation.  Therefore, our findings support that PTEN actively suppresses multiple factors and pathways involved in the major events driving pathological vascular remodeling and vascular disease progression.
